    <p class="paragraph" style="color: blueviolet">My Name is Adam Rademacher and This is my horoscope website. It is currently under development right now so all the features and tabs and the presentation are not what they are going to be when the website gets finished.
    I am currently a junior at Missouri University of Science and Technology Majoring in computer science. This website in the future will alow you to check your birthday zodiac sign details and along with checking you zodiac sign details, you will be able to see you lucky item, lucky place, love luck, and current luck.
    This website is meant to be for fun but also informative towards horoscopes so I hope you enjoy browsing when it is finished.
